        <section class="intro">
          <p> Born and raised in sunny Southern California I was one of the first junior rangers of Orange County.</p>
          <br><p> Most of my life was spent preparing to be a full fledged park ranger for the National Park Service. I learned German by living in Austria for a year, I got a degree in Natural Resources Mangagment from the University of Alaska, and I got another degree in Environmental Education from Griffith University in Brisbane Australia.

              <h2>Then I Saw More of the World</h2>
                  <p class="australia">At this point in my life I had seen a lot of the world, and but serverly missed living in Austrlia, and had some other things happening in my life that inspired me to go back. I decided that it was time I got a visa and bought a plane ticket. Within 6 months of the decision I was back in Brisbane.<br /> I was there for a year on a working holiday visa which allowed me to work for the Queensland Museum and the Queensland Performing Arts Centre.
